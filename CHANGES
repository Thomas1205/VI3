******* version 0.96 ******
- refined existing fertility variable exclusion
- implemented fertility variable exclusion based on forward-backward
- integrated a CountCutGenerator
- reduced the maximal cut size for Gomory Cuts
- now respecting the limit on the maximal fertility
- refined the specification of SOS

******* version 0.921 ******
- there is now also a limit on the size of Gomory cuts
  derived at the root node (which was intended from the start).
  This immensely reduces the peak memory for the hansards task.
- The limit at nodes other than the root node was also reduced


******* version 0.92 *******
- mentioned an independently developed similar method in the 
   LICENSE file
- the base solver is now directly modeled as an Osi interface 
  (this gives some run-time gains)
- removed a dynamic allocation in the integer heuristic
- special ordered sets can now be exploited by adding -DENABLE_SOS 
  to the compilation command. However, this seems to slow down the
  solver.
