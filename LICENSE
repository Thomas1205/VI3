This is a patch for the GIZA++ machine translation training toolkit
that allows to compute IBM-3 Viterbi alignments and use them in the
training process.  It was written by Thomas Schoenemann (Lund
University, Sweden) in 2010, the modified parts are clearly marked.


To use this software, you need the following packages:

- GIZA++ http://code.google.com/p/giza-pp/
- CBC http://www.coin-or.org/projects/Cbc.xml (tested with Version 2.4.0)
